# ML Based UPI Fraud Detection

UPI Fraud Detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities in transactions conducted via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that allows instant money transfers between bank accounts using a mobile device. With the widespread adoption of UPI, the risk of fraud has also increased, necessitating effective fraud detection mechanisms.
